He then set up Bogdan Bogdanovic for a go-ahead 3 and followed another by De'Andre Hunter by leaving Taj Gibson behind off the dribble and knocking down a jumper to cap an 11-0 spurt and make it 113-105 with 1:04 left.<br><br>Bogdanovic added a season-high 32 points for the Hawks, who dropped the Knicks six games behind them for 10th place in the Eastern Conference, the final spot in the play-in field.<br><br>RJ Barrett had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who fell to 30-42 to clinch their eighth losing season in the last nine. The only winning record was when they went 41-31 last season to earn the No. 4 seed in the East.<br><br>The Hawks then beat them in five games in the first round of the playoffs. Young was the star in his first postseason series, ignoring the profane taunts from fans and getting the last word when he bowed to the crowd from near midcourt late in Game 5.<br><br>Young missed the return trip when he was sidelined for the Christmas game because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols. Fans booed him every time he touched the ball early Tuesday, though that didn’t last.<br><br>Alec Burks had 21 points for the Knicks, who played without Julius Randle because of a sore right quadriceps tendon. They led by 10 early in the fourth, but the game changed when Young re-entered with 7:45 remaining.<br><br>The Knicks led 34-30 after one, a lead that would have been six if not for Bogdanovic taking the ball out after Barrett's basket with 0.6 seconds left and flinging it the length of the court to Young, who caught and tossed it in all in one motion.<br><br>New York extended it to 12 in the second before the Hawks surged ahead by nine and took a 64-58 lead into halftime. Bogdanovic had 15 points and Young 13 in the second quarter, combining for four more points than the Knicks scored.</span>","image":["http://maannews.maantechnology.com/public/uploads/images/newsimages/maannewsimage30012022_034427_basket_ball.jpg"],"date":"2021-10-23","news_subcategory":"Cricket","subcategory_id":1,"news_category":"Sports","category_id":2,"news_categoryslug":"sports-news","reporter_name":"Reporter 21"},{"id":38,"title":"Ice hockey Pictures the contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably","summary":"A couple of teams had a slow trade deadline day and that might hurt them down the stretch.

In no particular order, let’s take a brief look at the losers at Deadline Day:<br><br>1. Edmonton Oilers: They’ve been getting improved goaltending of late, but the Oilers not too long ago were in goalie hell with their current pair of Mikko Koskinen and Mike Smith. In Koskinen’s past two games, he’s put in sub-.900 save percentages, and in two of his past five appearances, Smith has posted a sub.860 SP.<br><br>Did Edmonton GM Ken Holland have all the reason in the world to go out and get a better goalie? He sure did. Could that failure to do so come back to haunt him once the playoffs begin? It sure could. Holland had all season long to find another netminder, and he knew the deadline was coming. It didn’t have to come to this, but now, it has. A goaltending crisis may prove to be what sinks the Oilers’ championship aspirations.<br>2. Toronto Maple Leafs: The Leafs land here with a caveat – namely, the acknowledgment that Toronto GM Kyle Dubas did improve his blueline and fourth line of forwards when he acquired D-man Mark Giordano and forward Colin Blackwell from Seattle on Sunday. However, their most pressing need – a veteran goalie to be given a shot at the No. 1 job until Jack Campbell returns from a rib injury – was not dealt with by the deadline.<br><br>That means, if rookie netminder Erik Kallgren crumbles under the pressure of the starter’s role, Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe will have no other alternative but to use Petr Mrazek. And anyone who has watched Mrazek’s recent games will tell you that’s not a good thing. Mrazek’s .884 SP and 3.48 goals-against average show his struggles with Toronto this season, and the pressure is only going to increase on him, whenever the Leafs decide to play him. Another soft goal here or there and Mrazek will be quickly pulled from games.<br><br>Dubas has claimed he waived Mrazek over the weekend as a salary cap move, but who’s kidding who - you don’t waive someone you really want to keep around. If, for whatever reason, another franchise decided to take a chance on Mrazek – for this year, and two more years, with a $3.8 million annual cap hit – there would be little in the way of mourning over Mrazek’s departure. Instead, Leafs brass now has to be cold-blooded in their analysis and deployment of goalies. Campbell and Kallgren will get the first chances to run with the No. 1 job, and if they fail, it will fall on Mrazek to get one last shot at proving himself in Toronto.</span>","image":["http://maannews.maantechnology.com/public/uploads/images/newsimages/maannewsimage21102021_122640_hocky.jpg"],"date":"2021-11-04","news_subcategory":"Cricket","subcategory_id":1,"news_category":"Sports","category_id":2,"news_categoryslug":"sports-news","reporter_name":"Reporter 12"},{"id":6,"title":"Official icc fooball - live matches  commentary rankings","summary":"Keep the door open for us: ACB CEO's plea to Cricket Australia","description":"<span style=\"color: rgb(16, 38, 74); font-family: Poppins; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;\">It’s\r\n been a day since the NHL’s 2021-22 trade deadline, and in addition to \r\nthe joy felt in markets that did well on the trade front, there’s \r\nalready angst, criticism and condemnation for various reasons in other \r\nNHL cities.
